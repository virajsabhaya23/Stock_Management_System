# Stock Management System

This group project was a part of our CSE 1325 programming class. This is a stock trading application that connects to the Alpha Vantage API and gets price information for a list of stocks. The user can purchase stocks, and the stocks show up on the user's portfolio page and are stored in the user's profile.
